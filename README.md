# _Symbiodinium_ communities in generalist and specifist corals across a gradient of thermal variance

The persistence of reef building corals is heavily dependent on their associated endosymbiotic assemblages of _Symbiodinium_. Corals span a gradient of symbiotic flexibility, from generalists to specifists and attributes of the symbiosis are considered to be a driving forces of coral performance under environmental stress. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increasing _in situ_ thermal variance would result in changes in symbiotic communities, and change would be dissimilar between a symbiotic generalist coral, _Acropora hyacinthus_ and specifist corals, massive _Porites sp_. We applied Roche 454 FLX sequencing of the ITS2 region (nrDNA) to ascertain Symbiodinium assemblage identity and similarity across coral species and temperature regimes. This sequencing approach exponentially increased our sampling depth, and identified the presence of clades A, C, D, F, and G. The _Symbiodinium_ assemblages differed between _Porites_ and _Acropora_, supporting the specifist and generalist designations, respectively.  Interestingly, these the _Symbiodinium_ comunities display different patterns of diversity as a function of thermal variance, with _Acropora_ assemblages homogenizing and _Porites_ assemblages displaying increasing flexibility at higher thermal variance.
