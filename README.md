# _Symbiodinium_ communities in generalist and specifist corals across a gradient of thermal variance

The persistence of reef building corals is heavily dependent on their associated endosymbiotic assemblages of _Symbiodinium_. Corals span a gradient of symbiotic flexibility, from generalists to specifists and attributes of the symbiosis are considered to be a driving forces of coral performance under environmental stress. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increasing _in situ_ thermal variance would result in changes in symbiotic communities, and change would be dissimilar between a symbiotic generalist coral, _Acropora hyacinthus_ and specifist corals, massive _Porites sp_. We applied Roche 454 FLX sequencing of the ITS2 region (nrDNA) to ascertain _Symbiodinium_ assemblage identity and similarity across coral species and temperature regimes. This sequencing approach exponentially increased our sampling depth, and identified the presence of clades A, C, D. 

Corals were collected from 6 different sites (n=10 fragments per species per site, with 2 missing total=58 samples). These sites were monitored with _in situ_ water temperature loggers and provide a gradient of daily tempeature fluctuation.
